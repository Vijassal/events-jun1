Ok, let's work on Vendors (/Users/vishaljassal/Desktop/events/app/vendors) next.

This is the infamour Vendors table that will communicate with many tables across the platform.

Customer will simply need to enter/input the following information in for Vendors:

- Name
- Date
- Time
- Location
- Type
- Category

Remember, this information feeds into Budget (/Users/vishaljassal/Desktop/events/app/budget) as well (the dropdown list for entry). This information will also feed into Vendor itinerary (which will be held on the planning page).

The only thing I may have a missed in Budget (/Users/vishaljassal/Desktop/events/app/budget) is that we will need to keep track of Budget, Actual Cost, Deposited Amount, Paid Amount and Assigned Users as well. You may need to help me with this.

The reason I need help with this is because there's always macro expenses and micro expenses (like booking a Banquet which costs 25k vs buying supplies for $200). We'll need a way to track this in Budget, not necessarily in Vendors as the Vendors section is to simply add, edit and remove Vendors like we did in Events (/Users/vishaljassal/Desktop/events/app/events). At some point, I will create a visual reporting which will show on the Dashboard of the overall of the project budget vs actual and other metrics.
