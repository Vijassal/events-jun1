## Summary of Changes

- Fixed currency conversion in the budget page so that the converted amount updates automatically when the cost field or currency dropdown changes.
- Diagnosed and resolved issues with the exchange rates not populating due to missing environment variables and script errors.
- Successfully ran the exchange rate update script, populating the `exchange_rates` table in Supabase.
- Verified that the currency conversion now works as expected in the app.
