# Project Notes (June 8, 2024, 4:46 PM)

## Sidebar and UI Enhancements

- Implemented a primary sidebar with a toggle button at the top left.
- Toggle button uses a custom SVG icon that visually flips the shaded bar from left (open) to right (closed).
- When the sidebar is closed, only the dashboard button remains visible; when open, dashboard, events, and settings are shown.
- All three nav icons (dashboard, events, settings) are displayed in a single horizontal row at the top of the sidebar.
- Icon labels are hidden by default and shown as tooltips on hover.
- Increased spacing between the nav icons for a cleaner look.
- Added horizontal divider lines above and below the icon row, matching the icon line thickness and color for visual balance.
- Removed the profile button from the sidebar for a cleaner interface.
- Ensured all changes are visually consistent and responsive.

## Sidebar Icon Alignment Update

- Adjusted the position of the section icons (Invite, Plan, Tasks, Budget, Vendors, Gallery) in the open sidebar state to be flush with the right edge of the sidebar (`right-0`).
- This change ensures the icons are visually aligned and consistent with the sidebar's design language.
- All other layout and color choices remain consistent with previous updates.

## Full Migration to Supabase Auth (June 8, 2024)

- **Authentication:**
  - Fully migrated from NextAuth.js/Prisma to Supabase Auth for all authentication and session management.
  - Removed all NextAuth and Prisma-based auth logic and API routes.
  - Registration and login now use `supabase.auth.signUp` and `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword`.
  - User data is now managed by Supabase Auth (visible in the Supabase dashboard).

- **Session Protection:**
  - Dashboard and all protected pages now check Supabase session on the client.
  - Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/auth/login`.

- **Logout Flow:**
  - Updated both the UserBar and Sidebar to use `supabase.auth.signOut()` and redirect to `/auth/login`.
  - Removed all links to `/auth/logout` (which caused 404s).
  - Logout now reliably clears the session and redirects to the login page.

- **File/Component Updates:**
  - `app/auth/register/page.tsx`: Uses Supabase for registration.
  - `app/auth/login/page.tsx`: Uses Supabase for login.
  - `app/dashboard/page.tsx`: Uses Supabase session for protection.
  - `src/components/UserBar.tsx`: Logout uses Supabase and full page reload.
  - `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`: Logout button (not a link) uses Supabase and full page reload.

- **Environment:**
  - Confirmed `.env` contains correct Supabase keys and URL.
  - No custom redirects or rewrites in `next.config.js`.

- **Debugging:**
  - Fixed 404 on logout by removing `/auth/logout` link and using a real logout handler.
  - Ensured all routes and session logic are working after server restart and cache clear.

- **Testing:**
  - Registration, login, dashboard protection, and logout all tested and working.
  - Users appear in Supabase Auth dashboard after registration.

## Sidebar Conditional Rendering Update (June 8, 2024, 4:52 PM)

- **Sidebar Visibility Logic:**
  - Updated the layout so the sidebar and user bar are only rendered when the user is signed in with Supabase Auth.
  - When signed out, the sidebar and user bar are completely hidden; only the main content is shown.
  - This ensures the sidebar never appears on the login or registration pages, or after logout.

- **Implementation Details:**
  - In `src/components/ClientLayout.tsx`, added logic to check the Supabase session on mount and listen for auth state changes.
  - Used `supabase.auth.getSession()` and `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange` to keep session state in sync.
  - If no session is present, the sidebar and user bar are not rendered at all.
  - All other layout and UI logic is preserved.

- **Testing:**
  - Verified that the sidebar appears immediately after login and persists while signed in.
  - Verified that the sidebar disappears immediately after logout, and does not appear on public pages.
  - All other app functionality and UI remain unchanged.

## Section Pages Debug & Resolution (June 8, 2024, 10:23 PM)

- **Issue:**
  - Navigating to routes like `/events`, `/invite`, `/plan`, `/budget`, `/vendors`, `/tasks`, and `/gallery` resulted in 404 errors and blank pages, even though the settings and dashboard pages worked.

- **Debugging Process:**
  - Verified the project directory in use was `/Users/vishaljassal/Desktop/events` (not the similarly named directory elsewhere).
  - Compared the structure of a working page (`/settings`) with the non-working sections.
  - Inspected the `/app/` directory and found that only folders like `settings`, `dashboard`, and `auth` existed, each with their own `page.tsx` file.
  - Confirmed that there were **no folders or `page.tsx` files** for `events`, `invite`, `plan`, `budget`, `vendors`, `tasks`, or `gallery`.
  - Determined that Next.js App Router requires a folder and a `page.tsx` file for each route to be accessible.

- **Resolution:**
  - Created the following folders and files in `/Users/vishaljassal/Desktop/events/app/`:
    - `events/page.tsx`
    - `invite/page.tsx`
    - `plan/page.tsx`
    - `budget/page.tsx`
    - `vendors/page.tsx`
    - `tasks/page.tsx`
    - `gallery/page.tsx`
  - Each file contains a simple React component with a heading and a placeholder message, confirming the route is working and ready for further development.
  - After these changes, all section routes now display their respective headings and placeholders as expected.

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - For Next.js App Router, every route must have a corresponding folder and `page.tsx` file in the `app/` directory.
  - Comparing a working route (like `/settings`) with a non-working one is an effective way to debug routing issues.
  - Always confirm you are working in the correct project directory, especially if there are similarly named folders elsewhere on the system.

- **Next Steps:**
  - Begin adding forms, lists, and Supabase integration to each section as planned.
  - Continue to use this structured approach for debugging and feature rollout.
