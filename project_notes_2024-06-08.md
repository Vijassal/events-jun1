# Project Notes (June 8, 2024, 4:46 PM)

## Sidebar and UI Enhancements

- Implemented a primary sidebar with a toggle button at the top left.
- Toggle button uses a custom SVG icon that visually flips the shaded bar from left (open) to right (closed).
- When the sidebar is closed, only the dashboard button remains visible; when open, dashboard, events, and settings are shown.
- All three nav icons (dashboard, events, settings) are displayed in a single horizontal row at the top of the sidebar.
- Icon labels are hidden by default and shown as tooltips on hover.
- Increased spacing between the nav icons for a cleaner look.
- Added horizontal divider lines above and below the icon row, matching the icon line thickness and color for visual balance.
- Removed the profile button from the sidebar for a cleaner interface.
- Ensured all changes are visually consistent and responsive.

## Sidebar Icon Alignment Update

- Adjusted the position of the section icons (Invite, Plan, Tasks, Budget, Vendors, Gallery) in the open sidebar state to be flush with the right edge of the sidebar (`right-0`).
- This change ensures the icons are visually aligned and consistent with the sidebar's design language.
- All other layout and color choices remain consistent with previous updates.

## Full Migration to Supabase Auth (June 8, 2024)

- **Authentication:**
  - Fully migrated from NextAuth.js/Prisma to Supabase Auth for all authentication and session management.
  - Removed all NextAuth and Prisma-based auth logic and API routes.
  - Registration and login now use `supabase.auth.signUp` and `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword`.
  - User data is now managed by Supabase Auth (visible in the Supabase dashboard).

- **Session Protection:**
  - Dashboard and all protected pages now check Supabase session on the client.
  - Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/auth/login`.

- **Logout Flow:**
  - Updated both the UserBar and Sidebar to use `supabase.auth.signOut()` and redirect to `/auth/login`.
  - Removed all links to `/auth/logout` (which caused 404s).
  - Logout now reliably clears the session and redirects to the login page.

- **File/Component Updates:**
  - `app/auth/register/page.tsx`: Uses Supabase for registration.
  - `app/auth/login/page.tsx`: Uses Supabase for login.
  - `app/dashboard/page.tsx`: Uses Supabase session for protection.
  - `src/components/UserBar.tsx`: Logout uses Supabase and full page reload.
  - `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`: Logout button (not a link) uses Supabase and full page reload.

- **Environment:**
  - Confirmed `.env` contains correct Supabase keys and URL.
  - No custom redirects or rewrites in `next.config.js`.

- **Debugging:**
  - Fixed 404 on logout by removing `/auth/logout` link and using a real logout handler.
  - Ensured all routes and session logic are working after server restart and cache clear.

- **Testing:**
  - Registration, login, dashboard protection, and logout all tested and working.
  - Users appear in Supabase Auth dashboard after registration.
